## Riley Edwards, username RileyEdw
## I'm interested in software development because, when I was a very small Riley, in my elementary and middle school we had a computer class and that included using Code.org, and I had a ton of fun using block-based code in code.org, and I was very good at it, as well. For a while, it didn't click in my head that I wanted to pursue software development, and I didn't really know what I wanted to be when I grew up. However, last year I had the chance to take Intro to Computer Science at New Tech. I remembered being good at Code.org, so I took the class. I did amazingly in that as well. So, I thought to myself "Well, I'm really good at coding, and I have some fun doing it, so I figure that would make a good career!" So that's why I'm interested in it. I have a dream of eventually making or contributing to making a video game, whether it be my own project or I have a job making them, but I'm open to doing other things with software development.
## I hope to learn about how to code effectively in various coding languages, and from cybersecurity, I hope to learn about other parts of computers and how they work, so I can be useful in more than just coding areas.
## My other hobbies include playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, which, to be fair, does involve a computer, since I use Google Docs to hold all the information about the game, but it doesn't center around the computer. I read books sometimes, and I like to pet and play with my cat, Moo Moo. I don't know if that last one counts as a hobby, but it's close enough, I would say.
